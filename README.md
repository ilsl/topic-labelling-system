# Topic Labelling System

This project explores a twitter customer dataset. It uses NLP to model topics in tweets. First Supervised Learning approaches are used and then unsupervised. 

These instructions will allow you to run these notebooks on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
